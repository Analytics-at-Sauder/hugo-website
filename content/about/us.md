The goal of this Project is to create an open repository for learning resources to enhance data analysis and meta-skills for business analytics professionals of all skill levels. The UBC Business Analytics Learning Resources will provide various opportunities for hands-on experience and experimentation, grounded in ‘real-life’ data and business problems, using open-source and cloud-based tools (e.g. Interactive Computing Environment, Jupyter Notebooks). These resources allow all users to enhance their meta-skills, including technical skills such as the ability to deploy the results of their analyses), where these skills are in high-demand in the both the business and data analytics industries.

The UBC Business Analytics Learning Resources repository contains real world problems, where business analytics programming skills will be used in providing solutions. These resources will benefit not only MBAN students, including alumni and prospective students, but also other students at UBC’s Sauder School of Business, including students of the MBA, BCOM, and MM programs. This website is also linked to a <a href="https://github.com/Analytics-at-Sauder/hugo-website" target="_blank">Github repository</a> that hosts the actual Python and R Notebooks, which are available for download and modification.
