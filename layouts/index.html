        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>The objective of <span class="fw-bold">Analytics@Sauder</span> is to curate a collection of open-source business analytics tools and
          resources, to promote opportunities for hands-on learning, to foster an online, academic community of business
          analytics, and to facilitate conversations around data analytics within a broader business context. We hope
          that the UBC Business Analytics Open Learning Resources can provide a platform of mutual learning: while we
          hope that this Project can be helpful to business analytics professionals of all skill levels, we appreciate
          all feedback on our resources so that we can continue to improve what we do. We welcome suggestions,
          contributions, and collaborations of all kinds.</p>

        <h2>For Educators</h2>
        <p>We invite educators to borrow from and contribute to this platform by referring to the various Notebooks for
          use inside and outside classrooms, providing feedback through our Blog and GitHub, and contacting us with any
          helpful resources especially data, scripts, and Notebooks. We see <span class="fw-bold">Analytics@Sauder</span> as a living learning tool
          that is constantly evolving and improving. By navigating to the <a href="/notebooks/menu">Notebooks page</a>, you can find a collection of
          Business Analytics Notebooks organized by Topics and Skills respectively. It is organized in this way to help
          students think about how analytics can be applied to different business domains, and at the same time,
          practice skills that will aid in the development of business insights. We value any feedback or suggestions
          for these Notebooks, and we encourage instructors to submit Issues and Pull Requests via GitHub, which you can
          learn more about on the <a href="/resources/list">Resources page.</a></p>
